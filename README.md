# COVID Tracker

### This is an app built with the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) Framework. It's a simple project I made to learn flutter!

## Install
### Unfortunately, This app is only available for Android, as I don't own a Mac to build the app properly.

### Install the APK [here](https://github.com/huss-a/flutter-covid-tracker/releases)
